We are five students from around the world, Juan, Giulia, Geza, Raphaël and Cyrill that met on the EPFL campus. 
From this meeting was born a pirate crew who braved all the ADAs storms together to create a great project. 
What project? Well this one, you can check out our github:

Our project was part of the 2023 edition of the class “Applied Data Analysis” (CS-401) at EPFL.
