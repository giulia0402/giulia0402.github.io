## Abstract

From mythology to science fiction, people have always invented stories. The ability to create fiction (defined by the American Heritage Dictionary as creative work whose content is imagined and is not based on real facts) can even be viewed as characteristic of the human race. All types of fiction invite their audience to explore real ideas, issues, or possibilities using an imaginary setting or using something similar to reality, though still distinct from it. In this project, we want to extract movies that fall in the category "speculative fiction" as defined in Wikipedia [1], to distill the content of people's imaginations and their evolution over time.

With the CMU movie summary corpus as the starting point, the first step is to get a subset of summaries representative of speculative fictional summaries. We approach this first step in two ways: we directly search for the genre of the movies related to speculative fiction in the dataset and hope to improve and extend the classification by training a Naive Bayes model. Once we have the dataset of fictional summaries, we will perform sentimental analysis to study how positive the stories are. To find out what the stories are about, we implement topic modeling with a Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model to identify themes among them.
